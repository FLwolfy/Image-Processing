    "For some binary images that are purely black or white, special processing is sometimes necessary. For instance, in Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE), we may have simplified circuit boards. If we need to quickly identify where there are breaks or holes, we can use **morphological processing** to process the image and extract the desired information. This entire process reminds me of **homeomorphism** in topology. There are three primary types of morphological processing:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Shrink\n",
    "**Shrink** is a morphological operation that reduces the size of the white regions in a binary image. The goal is to remove small details and simplify the shape without altering the overall structure too much. This operation is typically performed using **erosion** iteratively, which removes pixels from the boundaries of the white regions. Shrinking an image helps in isolating the main components and removing noise or irrelevant small objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Method**: Apply the shrinking stucture elements in the patterns chart iteratively to remove the outermost pixels of white regions.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Reduce the size of the foreground objects in the binary image.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Thin\n",
    "**Thin** is a morphological operation that reduces objects to a one-pixel wide representation, effectively thinning them while retaining the overall structure. This is particularly useful for extracting the central skeleton of shapes, like in skeletonization. Thinning is done by iteratively removing pixels from the objectâ€™s boundaries, ensuring that the objectsâ€™ topology remains the same.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Method**: Apply thinning stucture elements iteratively to peel away pixels from the boundary of objects until they are reduced to a minimal representation.\n",
    "- **Purpose**: Create a thin representation of the objects while preserving their topological properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Skeletonize\n",
    "**Skeletonization** is a form of thinning that reduces shapes to their skeleton or central path. Unlike general thinning, skeletonization maintains the connectivity of the objects and removes all extraneous pixels. This is very useful for identifying the main features and paths within an image, such as roads, wires, or bones in medical images.\n",

    "In daily life, we often need to print images. Sometimes, we may only have black ink, and in such cases, we can only print grayscale images. In more extreme cases, when we can only print pure black and white, how can we print a grayscale image? This is where **digital halftoning** comes in, converting grayscale into the density of black pixels, which tricks our brain into perceiving shades of gray.\n",
    "\n",
    "I implemented four methods for this:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Fixed Threshold Dithering\n",
    "This method is very simple and intuitive. A threshold is provided, and if the pixelâ€™s grayscale value is greater than this threshold, it is set to white; otherwise, it is set to black. However, due to the simplicity of this method, the result is not very good.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Random Dithering\n",
    "As the name suggests, in this method, each pixel generates a random grayscale value. If the pixelâ€™s grayscale value is greater than the randomly generated grayscale value, it is set to white; otherwise, it is set to black. I believe this method works better than fixed threshold dithering, as the random effect makes our brains ignore some of the finer details.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the implementation, I used two approaches:\n",
    "- The first approach uses the built-in C++ random number generator with a seed to produce random numbers.\n",
    "- The second approach uses a custom hash algorithm. By providing a seed and using a large prime number, I incorporate the pixelâ€™s grayscale value and coordinates, compute the remainder with the large prime number, and then clamp the result between 0 and 255. This generates a more evenly distributed hash.\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparison of the effects of the two random algorithms is shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Dithering Matrix\n",
    "This method mainly uses Bayerâ€™s index algorithm for ordered dithering. By using a fixed Bayer index matrix, we dynamically generate a corresponding threshold matrix and then perform black-and-white determination based on the matrix's thresholds. This method produces better results than the first two.\n",
    "\n",
    "I also provide an interface to automatically generate Bayer matrices of different sizes, and the dithering effect will vary accordingly. Additionally, I considered the display situation: typically, we don't have extreme cases where only pure black and white are possible. So, I introduced an input called `numOfLevels`, which allows you to specify the number of grayscale levels your printer can provide. The generated image will then contain only these grayscale levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process works by setting grayscale levels with `numOfLevels`. For each pixel, the threshold is calculated using `bayer_threshold * (255 / numOfLevels)`. Then, by comparing `pixel[i][j] - level[k]` with the threshold, if the difference is greater than the threshold, the pixel becomes `level[k + 1]`; otherwise, it remains at `level[k]`. The implementation details can be found in `process.cpp`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Floyd-Steinberg Error Diffusion Dithering (FSEDD)\n",
    "This is the method I believe has the best result, although it is also the most complex. The main approach is to declare a dithering method (I provide fixed and Bayer options), then calculate the pixel's error and diffuse this error to subsequent pixels in order to reduce the visual discomfort caused by the error.\n",
    "\n",
    "To address some odd effects or bugs, I provide an option to choose the pixel traversal method. You can choose between **serpentine scanning** or **standard scanning**, which results in different effects, as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "In summary, after using these different methods, I believe that the **Bayer dithering-based FSEDD** method produces the best results. It can recreate most of the grayscale details of an image, even when only pure black and white are available."
